		<h1>About Me</h1> 
		<a href="https://placeholder.com"><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/250x150" class="auth-image"></a>
		<p>I am a certified 6-12 Math Teacher and have a masters degree in Industrial 
			Engineering. At the beginning of my career I worked for Texas Instruments. I was repsonsible for keeping track of MLO costs for the products being built 
			and working on ways to decrease the cost. I left after 2 years to attend the Univeristy
			of Michigan and get my masters in Industrial Engineering specializing in Occupational Safety and Health.
			After graduating, I worked for Microswitch, a division of Honeywell, Tellabs, and Tadpole 
			Technology. 
		</p>
		<p>After 10 years working in the engineering field, I became interested in teaching,
			and earned a 6-12 Math Teaching Certificate. I taught middle and high school in Austin,
			Texas and Sacramento California. I spent the last 14 years teaching middle school Math
			at Kealing Middle School.
